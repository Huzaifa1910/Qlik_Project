# Project Name "Website Scraping and MySQL Database Dumping Project"
## Project Overview
This project involves scraping data from a website and storing it in a MySQL database using Python, Selenium, Beautiful Soup, and Airflow. The project is built on an Ubuntu server running on Windows.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to automate the process of scraping data from a website and storing it in a database. By automating this process, we can save time and improve accuracy by eliminating the need for manual data entry.

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used in this project:

Python
Selenium
Beautiful Soup
MySQL
Airflow
How It Works
The project begins by scraping the website using Selenium and Beautiful Soup. The scraped data is then stored in a MySQL database using the mysql.connector package. Airflow is used to automate the entire process, including scheduling and monitoring the scraping and dumping of data.

To ensure the security of the project, a new user is created with appropriate privileges for remote access to the MySQL database. Additionally, the necessary packages are installed to enable Airflow to write to MySQL.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Install Python and MySQL.

## Clone the project from the GitHub repository.
### Create a user in MySQL 
"CREATE USER 'newuser'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';"
"GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'newuser'@'%';"
Note: Replace newuser and password with the desired username and password.

Start Airflow and run the DAG to begin scraping and dumping data.
to make connection with  MySQL you have to add connection in airflow, from connection tab
when you were adding connection of MySQL you will not find MySQL in connection type to add it there run following commands and contribute in the documentation by correcting the step
### command 1:
"sudo apt-get update"
"sudo apt-get install mysql-server"

### command 2:
"pip install mysqlclient"

### command 3:
"pip install mysql-connector-python"

# Usage
To use this project, simply run the DAG in Airflow. The DAG will scrape the website and dump the data into the MySQL database automatically, based on the schedule you set in Airflow.

# Conclusion
This project is an efficient and automated way to scrape data from a website and store it in a MySQL database. By automating the process, the project saves time and eliminates the need for manual data entry. The security measures taken ensure the safety and integrity of the scraped data.
